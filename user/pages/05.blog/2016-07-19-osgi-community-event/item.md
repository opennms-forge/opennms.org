# OSGi Community Event 2016

Our english ambassador for OpenNMS Craig Gallen will give a talk about releasing the potential of [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) using [OSGi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi), [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) and [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch).
The talk gives some insights about the current projects to integrate OpenNMS with ElasticSearch and Cassandra to provide a very scalable platform for processing data from an IoT environment.
