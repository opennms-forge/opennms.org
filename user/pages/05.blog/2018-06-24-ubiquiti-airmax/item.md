Ubiquiti is getting more and more a well known manufacturer for Wifi routers all over the world for in- and also outdoor devices.
At this years' OpenNMS DevJam we've created datacollection for the AirMax devices.
This series is usually used for point to point connections for short, middle and long distances.

Ubiquiti provides a lot metrics like signal strenghtes, distances, system performance and specific AirMax related metrics.

You can find the the configuration files on [Github](https://github.com/opennms-config-modules/ubiquiti)

Also we've created a [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/6498) to present all these metrics at a glance.
