Every OpenNMS user knows about the node level performance data graphs in OpenNMS.
These are always a good starting point to investigate issues or compare current metrics with older ones.

If you are also using Grafana, you can know benefit, because we've created a dashboard for these metrics.
It was never so easy to get an overview about a nodes' state!

Check out the new dashboards for [Linux](https://grafana.com/dashboards/6070) and [Windows](https://grafana.com/dashboards/6161)
